shorttitle: Absence of EC with briefly presented CSs
abstract: Previous research has claimed that evaluative conditioning (EC) effects
  may obtain in the absence of perceptual identification of conditioned stimuli (CSs).
  A recent meta-analysis, based on a small body of evidence ($k = 8$ studies), suggested
  similar effect sizes for supra- and subliminal CSs [@hofmann_evaluative_2010]. We
  critically discuss this prior evidence, and then report and discuss six experimental
  studies that investigate EC effects for briefly presented CSs using more stringent
  methods. Across these studies, we varied a number of parameters, namely CS duration,
  the presence or absence of a masking procedure, the presence or absence of a visibility
  check, CS material, and the orienting instructions communicated to participants.
  Across studies, we were consistently unable to obtain evidence for briefly presented
  and masked EC effects. In most studies, this pattern was observed despite above-chance
  identification of the CSs. A meta-analysis conducted across the 27 experimental
  conditions supports the conclusion that EC effects for briefly presented and masked
  CSs are either not robust, are very small, or are limited to specific conditions
  that remain to be identified (or any combination of these).
