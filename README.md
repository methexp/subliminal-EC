### Abstract:

>  Previous research has claimed that evaluative conditioning (EC) effects
  may obtain in the absence of perceptual identification of conditioned stimuli (CSs).
  A recent meta-analysis suggested similar effect sizes for supra- and subliminal
  CSs, but this was based on a small body of evidence (*k = 8* studies; Hofmann et al., 2010).
  We critically discuss this prior evidence, and then report and discuss six experimental
  studies that investigate EC effects for briefly presented CSs using more stringent
  methods. Across these studies, we varied CS duration, the presence or absence of
  masking, the presence or absence of a CS identification check, CS material, and
  the instructions communicated to participants. EC effects for longer-duration CSs
  were modulated by attention to the CS-US pairing. Across studies, we were consistently
  unable to obtain EC for briefly presented CSs. In most studies, this pattern was
  observed despite above-chance perceptual identification of the CSs. A meta-analysis
  conducted across the 27 experimental conditions supported the null hypothesis of
  no EC for perceptually unidentified CSs. We conclude that EC effects for briefly
  presented and masked CSs are either not robust, are very small, or are limited to
  specific conditions that remain to be identified (or any combination of these).
